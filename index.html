					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>
							The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as vehicular networks, autonomous driving, multi-agent systems, and smart cities, heralds a transformative era with the potential to reshape daily life, professional endeavors, and industrial manufacturing. As communication technologies and their applications grow exponentially, the integration of space, air, and ground networks has emerged as a pivotal innovation driver. The convergence of sensing, communication, and computing across aerial, terrestrial, and maritime domains unlocks significant new opportunities, though considerable challenges remain in realizing these advances. Meanwhile, smart robotic systems such as drones are increasingly deployed in industrial applications and daily life, particularly in high-risk scenarios like emergency rescue, search and tracking, and post-disaster recovery. These complex applications often require collaboration across multiple robots, enabled by advanced communication networks that integrate space-air-ground infrastructure and AI-driven coordination. This workshop aims to bring together and disseminate the latest research advances in space-air-ground network integration and innovative AI approaches that support multi-agent coordination in integrated environments to address a spectrum of issues related to radio frequency (RF) system, network optimization, machine learning, multi-agent coordination, and multi-modal planning and scheduling for real-world applications. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>

						<ul>
							<li> AI-Empowered Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks 
							<li> AI-Empowered Sensing, Communications, and Computing Integrated Networks
